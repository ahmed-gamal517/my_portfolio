      '''I am a passionate software developer with a strong focus on mobile app development using Flutter. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Modern University for Technology and Information (MTI), where I graduated in 2023. After completing my one-year military service in December 2024, I began working as a Teaching Assistant at MTI University, further deepening my understanding of software principles and mentoring others in their tech journey.\n
I have completed several professional courses in Flutter and have gained hands-on experience building self-initiated projects that follow best practices such as Clean Architecture, MVVM, and state management using Cubit and BLoC. My approach to development emphasizes clean code, scalable architecture, and a user-centric mindset.\n
With a solid foundation in both theory and practice, I am now actively seeking opportunities to contribute as a Flutter Developer. I'm eager to work on impactful projects, collaborate with talented teams, and continue growing in the ever-evolving tech landscape. ''';
